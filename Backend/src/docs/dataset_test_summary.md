## Key Insights

### Positive Findings
1. **Excellent Core Performance**: 14/15 cases (93.3%) completed successfully
2. **Perfect Response Rate**: 100% success rate for answered questions (70/70)
3. **Consistent Quality**: All successful responses were contextually appropriate and in proper Thai
4. **Good Response Times**: Average 1.18s response time is very reasonable
5. **Fallback System Works**: Several cases successfully triggered and answered fallback questions

### Areas for Improvement
1. **Field Name Normalization**: One case failed due to data structure handling
2. **Fallback Question Triggering**: Some cases with fallback questions didn't trigger them naturally
3. **Token Efficiency**: Some variation in token usage across cases (439-620 tokens/question)

### Technical Observations
1. **Model Consistency**: Fixed seed in exam mode provides reproducible results
2. **Memory Management**: Summarization strategy appears to work well
3. **Thai Language Proficiency**: Excellent natural Thai responses across all medical scenarios
4. **Role-Playing Accuracy**: Maintained mother/caregiver persona consistently

## Medical Scenario Coverage
The dataset successfully covers diverse pediatric medical scenarios:
- Breastfeeding issues
- Child health checkups  
- Congenital conditions (phimosis, hydrocele)
- Acute conditions (fever with rash, edema, gastroenteritis)
- Chronic conditions (iron deficiency, constipation)
- Infectious diseases (tuberculosis screening)
- Neonatal conditions (jaundice)
- Emergency scenarios (blood in stool)

## Recommendation
The Virtual Patient Simulator demonstrates excellent performance across the extracted dataset with a 93.3% success rate. The one failed case appears to be a technical issue rather than a fundamental problem with the approach. The system shows strong potential for medical education use cases.

## Next Steps
1. Fix the data handling issue in case 01_06
2. Investigate why some fallback questions aren't triggered naturally
3. Consider optimizing token usage for better cost efficiency
4. Expand testing to additional medical scenarios if available
